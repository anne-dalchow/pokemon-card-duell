# pokemon-card-duell

This is the result of a coding challenge from Mimo.org. The project involved developing a card duel game using the Pokemon API. 
We were free to implement this challenge. The most important thing was to create a card duel using the API data. 
Unfortunately, due to Mimo's IDE, we weren't able to upload many additional files, such as images, so I kept the design minimalist.

The result is a small, wonderful project with which I actually achieved first place and learned a lot about implementing API data and creating a game with this.
